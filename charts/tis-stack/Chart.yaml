# TYPE:
#   'application' is the default for charts that deploy services.
#   The alternative would be 'library', which only provides templates/functions
#   but creates no artifacts on its own.
type: application

# CHART VERSION:
#   Tracks the version of the *installer logic* (Templates, Values structure).
#   This should be incremented when you change the YAML templates, even if the
#   underlying software (Redis/Postgres) hasn't changed.
version: 0.1.0

# APP VERSION:
#   Tracks the version of the *software being deployed* (e.g., the Redis binary).
#   This is purely informational for Helm but appears in 'helm list' output.
#   It helps operators quickly see what version of the app is running.
