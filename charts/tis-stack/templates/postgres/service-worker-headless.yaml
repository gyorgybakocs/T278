  # DISCOVERY MODE:
  #   'clusterIP: None' creates a Headless Service.
  #   WHY: Instead of a single VIP (Virtual IP) that load balances across pods,
  #   this DNS entry returns the A-records of ALL individual pod IPs directly.
  #   This is mandatory for StatefulSets, allowing the Coordinator to address
  #   specific workers by name (e.g., 'tis-stack-postgres-worker-0.postgres-worker-headless...').
  type: ClusterIP
